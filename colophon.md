Colophon  
: *historical* A statement at the end of a book, typically with a printer’s emblem, giving information about its authorship and printing. [OED](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/colophon)

Should you ever ask yourself, "how does one make such a thing?," start looking for a colophon. If you make something mentionable, try to let others know how it was done.   

## This Very Site  

This page is built in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) using Michael Rose's [Minimal Mistakes theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes). It's primarily written in Fletcher Penney's [MultiMarkdown Composer](http://multimarkdown.com/) or Brett Terpstra's [nvALT][nvALT].  

[nvALT]: http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/.   

## Writing Formats  

I've been using Fletcher Penney's [MultiMarkdown][mmd] so long, it's committed to muscle memory. In other words, it's part of my way of interfacing with the world, just like other languages and syntaxes. If you plan to use any variant of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), I recommend this one.  

For keeping my mental lines of flight somewhat directed, I've developed something that's an awful lot like Ryder Carroll's [Bullet Journal](http://www.bulletjournal.com/). Even if you're not prone to distraction, that well-designed website deserves a visit.

## Writing Programs   

Brett Terpstra's [nvALT][nvALT] combines plain text files, [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) sync, and a variety of well-thought features to make it the writing equivalent of the maximal-minimalist, delight-is-in-the-details visual aesthetic that [The Designers Republic™](http://thedesignersrepublic.com/) often use for [Warp Records](http://warp.net/). For those unfamiliar, that means it's *ace*.  

Sam Nguyen's [TextDrop](https://www.textdropapp.com) lets you connect to your Dropbox notes even when you're not on your own device. I almost always have this open in a tab at work to keep a log of what I am doing, will do, and haven been doing.[^hgg]  

## Link Conventions   

Whenever possible, I link to [WorldCat](http://www.worldcat.org/) records for books. Why promote booksellers instead of libraries?   

[^hgg]: Yes, that last bit is a nod to Douglas Adam's [*Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49710059) and the troubles time travel presents to grammar. Of course, we're all time traveling—just in one direction. But I digress....
