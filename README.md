--------

This is a static site primarily made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme, tinkering, and patience.  

You might also encounter [Bigfoot.js](http://www.bigfootjs.com/) and [Reveal.js](http://revealjs.com/) scattered throughout this site. [AnchorJS](http://bryanbraun.github.io/anchorjs/) provides the GitHub-style deep anchor links (the clickable `#` to the right of each heading). [Staticman](https://staticman.net) is the hero this city needs, unerringly providing a super method for comments.  

Take [a look here](http://ryan-p-randall.github.io/).  

If you're looking to make a similar website for yourself, here's a great [set of introductions & instructions to Jekyll & GitHub Pages](http://www.trevordjones.com/jekyll).
