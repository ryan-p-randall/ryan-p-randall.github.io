message: "Nice thought. I do pretty the same for my notes and writing. I think MarkDown and Bullet Journal are best for minimal but more productive way of producing ideas and writing. Methods very close (or actually like) old fashioned pen & paper.\r\nPlain text -- with MarkDown or not -- is the best choice for simple way of writing and future-proof digital stuff."
