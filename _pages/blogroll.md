Blogs! They're like podcasts for reading!  

Here are some of the ones I follow and always enjoy reading in [my RSS reader of choice](https://netnewswire.com/) (where I also lifted that "podcasts for reading" line).  

There's enough here that I almost always have more to read when I open up my RSS app, which is helping wean me away from social media's tiny shards of attention and toward somewhat longer pieces of thought. These are a mix of ones I've followed the longest and ones that are most regularly updated.  

[This is a first pass as of 2024-02-18. I'll go back and add/describe more soon enough.]
