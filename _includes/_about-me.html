<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>As the Instruction and Outreach Librarian for <a href="https://cwidaho.cc/">the College of Western Idaho</a>, I'm working with students, faculty, and other librarians to help promote critical information literacy and library use, both physical and online.</p> 

<p>Prior to librarianship, I picked up an MA in <a href="http://english.ucr.edu/">English from the University of California, Riverside</a> and an MA in <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/college/vcs/">Visual and Cultural Studies from the University of Rochester</a>. While a humanities graduate student, then as an adjunct, I taught what librarians call information literacy skills as the instructor for many first-year writing seminar courses and lower-division American Studies and Film/Media courses. I have also been a college writing tutor for undergraduate and graduate students. The path of librarianship took me to <a href="http://www.soic.indiana.edu/graduate/degrees/information-library-science/master-library-science/">IU Bloomington's MLS program</a>, where my favorite courses emphasized critical information literacy, humanities subject librarianship, and digital humanities.</p>

<p>I've also recently become the Web Editor for <a href="http://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/">In the Library with the Lead Pipe</a>, an open access, open peer reviewed library journal.</p>

<p>Outside of that, I've hosted a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Hydrogen-Jukebox-57513727143/">college radio show</a> on <a href="http://kucr.org/">KUCR</a> &amp; <a href="http://wrur.org/">WRUR</a>, been in at least <a href="http://raincrossunderground.omeka.net/items/browse?tags=Kiss+Kill+You">one band</a>, and learned how to put into praxis many of the insights from my cultural studies &amp; other reflective pursuits through participation in various <a href="http://raincrossunderground.omeka.net/">do-it-ourselves communities</a>. If you're looking for communities related to librarianship, you might start by checking out <a href="http://critlib.org/">#critlib</a> and <a href="http://hacklibraryschool.com/">Hack Library School</a>, each of which I often look to for insights.</p>
