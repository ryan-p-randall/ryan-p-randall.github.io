# Ryan P. Randall's Website  

This is a static site primarily made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme, tinkering, and patience.  

You might also encounter [Bigfoot.js](http://www.bigfootjs.com/) and [Reveal.js](http://revealjs.com/) scattered throughout this site. 

Take [a look here](http://ryan-p-randall.github.io/).  

If you're looking to make a similar website for yourself, here's a great [set of introductions & instructions to Jekyll & GitHub Pages](http://www.trevordjones.com/jekyll).
